        "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.In a medium bowl, combine the peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla and 2 tablespoons of the coconut flour until well blended. Add additional coconut flour if the peanut mixture is too soft  it should be pliable and easy to form into shapes with your hands.Using a tablespoon or ice cream scoop, drop spoonfuls of the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Form into balls and flatten each ball slightly with your fingers. Place in the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes until firm.Melt the chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring often, until melted. Let cool for a few minutes and then dip each of the frozen peanut butter pieces into the chocolate to coat completely. Using a fork is a good way to do this and be sure to work quickly.Transfer each peanut butter cup back to the baking sheet and return to the freezer. Sprinkle with a little coarse sea salt if desired. Chill until set, about 1 hour or more. These will keep well in the freezer for several days, if they last that long.Note: You can make a half batch instead, but these are so good, you won't want to do that, especially as they keep so well.",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Preheat oven to 375F with the rack in middle position.</li><li>Make the Scone Mix.</li><li>Using a Food Processor fitted with a steel knife blade: Place half the butter and half the dry ingredients in the bowl. Pulse until the butter is reduced to pea-sized pieces, with dough still dry. Transfer first half of the mix into a large bowl. Repeat process with the other half of the ingredients and add to the large bowl.</li><li>By hand: Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the dough. Cut by pressing on butter, then gathering flour onto it in two quick strokes.  Cut until butter slices become pea-sized.</li><li>Dont over process or mix. Dough will be dry. Break large lumps of butter by hand, and toss dry dough with your fingers.</li><li>Blend the cheeses, dill, shallot and pepper with the Scone Mix using a wooden spoon. Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.</li><li>Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.</li><li>Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.</li><li>Serve warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.</li></ol>",

        "Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottom pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook for 6 to 8 minutes, turning frequently, until lightly browned and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onion and saut for a few minutes. Add the garlic, cumin, turmeric, ground coriander, garam masala, ginger and cook for one minute.\nMix the corn starch with the coconut milk until smooth. Return the chicken to the pan and stir in the coconut milk, brown sugar and tomatoes. Cook over medium heat and stir for 1 to 2 minutes. Partially cover and cook for 15 more minutes until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Stir in the lemon juice and season with salt.\nServe the creamy chicken curry on a bed of yellow rice (I use brown rice cooked in water with salt and 1 teaspoon of turmeric) sprinkled with fresh cilantro.",

Mash using a large wooden spoon or a hand held potato masher. Mash until soft, but some chunks remain. You don't want a completely smooth texture. Add in your noodles and toss to coat. Taste for seasoning and add more if necessary. If mixture seems dry, add more milk and butter until the entire mixture is lightly coated. Place in casserole dish. Sprinkle with the remaining ½ cup of cheese. Bake in your preheated oven for 25 minutes or until cheese starts to bubble. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "<ol><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut the bell peppers lengthwise, remove the seeds and stems.  Lightly oil the bell peppers by tossing them in a bowl with some grapeseed oil or olive oil.  Place the peppers on a baking sheet skin-side down. Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the edges begin to show some color.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.</li><li>While the peppers are roasting, prepare your stuffing.  Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined.  Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.</li><li>Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet.  There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).</li><li>Put on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.</li></ol>",

While brown \nrice is cooking prepare rest of meal.\n\nPERFECT BROWN RICE\n1 cup uncooked brown rice\n1 tsp. olive oil\n2 cups filtered water\n2 basil leaves (optional)\n\n\nFix brown rice by cooking in 1 tsp. olive oil until lightly browned. Place 2 basil leaves on top of rice and add 2 cups water all at once. Quickly put on lid and bring to boil. Turn down heat to simmer until all water has evaporated (around 40 minutes).\nHeat oil in a wok or large frying pan.  Add the garlic and cook on medium until lightly golden.  Watch carefully so you do not burn garlic.\nAdd the red chili peppers, cashew nuts and toasted coconut.  Mix together stevia, Nama Shoyu and apple cider vinegar together.  Cook over medium heat for 1 minutes.\nPush stir-fry to one side of pan and add flax on opposite end.

        "Peel and mash your plantain till soft. Mix it with the flour, form mini balls and place in the oven to bake for about 20-25 minutes. Please note the plantain mix will still be moist so use a spoon to help form the balls if you are having difficulty with that. Make sure to drizzle oil on the baking sheet so it does not stick to the sheet when it begins to caramelize. If you do not have an oven you can choose to fry the plantain balls as well. I have not tried the frying method but make sure to dab off the excess oil from the plantain.In a separate pot, on very low heat, melt the butter and pour in the sugar, vanilla, milk and water and stir. Leave it on very low heat throughout. Stir once in a while and if you have a candy thermometer, it is ready at 240F. If you do not, the toffee base is ready when it turns light brown like a caramel colour.Dip the plantain balls and swirl and place on a plate to cool. While its still warm, sprinkle your toppings on it. In this case, my toppings were coconut flakes. Serve when it’s cool.",

Pour in the sponge mixture Bake in preheated oven at 180C for about 20 minutes or until done (the trick with a toothpick).</li><li>Leave the cake to cool completely in the cake pan, then carefully remove it and split into two layers.</li><li>For the caramel cream heat sugar and water over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and comes to a boil. Continue cooking, but without stirring, until mixture becomes golden amber in color. Remove from flame and set aside.</li><li>Whip the cream, gradually stir in the caramel syrup.</li><li>Add peanuts, stir and combine. Mixture must be smooth (at first it will foam up a little). Transfer the cream to a bowl to cool down to room temperature and thicken.</li><li>For the ganache bring the cream just to a boil over medium-high heat; pour over chocolate. Let stand 10 minutes. Stir very gently for 3-4 minutes until smooth and glossy, incorporating the cream steadily, without overworking.</li><li>Cool ganache for an hour or until completely chilled, then beat for 2-3 minutes or until it becomes fluffy and lighter in color. Do not overbeat because it will become too thick and not spreadable.</li><li>To assemble the cake, first sprinkle each cake layer with half of the rum and water syrup.</li><li>Spread the caramel cream over the bottom layer, cover with the top layer (wet side down).</li><li>Immediately spread ganache over top and sides of cake.</li></ol>",

      instructions:
        "Position a rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees.\nAdd butter to a 9 inch round baking pan and place inside of a warm oven until melted, about 5 minutes.\nRemove from oven and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over the butter.\nAdd figs, flesh side up.\nSprinkle with 1  tsp of the rosemary.\nFill in the nooks and crannies with walnut pieces.\nIn a medium bowl sift flour, baking powder, and salt together.\nIn a separate bowl beat eggs with sugar at medium speed until creamy.\nBecause I liked this cake better with the eggs added whole rather than separating and adding the egg whites at the end, I beat the eggs and sugar for an additional 3 minutes until they were frothy and small bubbles formed.\nAdd the flour mixture to the creamed mixture and beat until well combined.\nPour cake batter evenly over the fruit and smooth with a spatula.\nBake for 35 to 40 minutes or until cake is golden and a toothpick into the center comes out clean.\nPlace on a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes.\nRun a blunt knife around the edges of the pan to loosen the cake.\nInvert carefully onto a plate.\nServe warm or at room temperature. Leftovers are yummy heated for about 15 seconds in the microwave!\nDelicious with a bold cup of java or a cool glass of Chardonnay like this one  Edna Valley 2010 Paragon. Crisp, citrusy with a hint of peach and a small amount of spice. Great paring with the strong lemon base of this cake!",

        "Rinse the cannellini beans and soak for 8 hours or overnight in several inches of water. Drain and rinse, then transfer to a medium saucepan and cover with fresh water. Add the curry leaves or bay leaf and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 1 hour or until the beans are tender but not falling apart. Drain and transfer to a large salad bowl.Meanwhile, snap the woody ends off of the asparagus spears and steam the spears for 6 minutes or until just tender but still retaining their crunch. Transfer to the salad bowl.Now cook the mushrooms. Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. As soon as the oil is hot, drop in the mushrooms and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes or until the mushrooms begin to brown and lose some of their liquid. Transfer to the bowl with the asparagus.To make the dressing, combine the tarragon, lemon zest, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and mustard in a small food processor or blender. Process until smooth.Pour the dressing over the salad, season with salt and pepper, and toss. Serve at room temperature or chilled.",

Brush them lightly with vegetable oil (I always use olive oil, but I am certain that this recipe would be best with a peanut oil). Place them on a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes, turning once.</li><li>In a small pan, heat butter and garlic on low until the butter has just almost melted. Add the apples, tofu, and salt. Bring heat up to medium, and cook for about 4 minutes. At this point you should add the water and stir every minute for the next 6-7 additional minutes, or until there is little moisture left in the pan. Turn off the heat, and add the brown sugar. Stir to incorporate all of the sugar. Place on top of salad lettuce.</li></ol>",
